DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

OVERVIEW : SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM

Overview of the Speech Recognition System Simulation
This code simulates a basic speech recognition system using push buttons as input to represent voice commands. The system turns an LED ON/OFF and activates a buzzer based on the button press, simulating voice-controlled actions.

### ** Objectives:**
Simulate a voice command-based control system using push buttons.Control an LED and buzzer to represent real-world speech-based automation.Display command execution on the serial monitor.


 ### **Key Components:**
1. Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. Push Buttons (Simulating Speech Commands)
3. LED (Indicating ON/OFF status)
4. Buzzer (Indicating alert or response)
5. Serial Monitor (Displaying command execution)

 
### **Technology Used:**
Embedded C Programming
Microcontroller-based Control System
Digital Input/Output Handling
Serial Communication (UART)

 **Applications:**
 
 .Home Automation: Voice-controlled lights, alarms, and appliances.
 .Assistive Technology: Hands-free device control for disabled individuals.
 .Industrial Automation: Simulated machine control using speech commands.
 .IoT Integration: Can be extended with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for remote control.

 **SIMULATED OUTPUT**
